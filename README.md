## 👋 About Me (real version, but fun)

I’m a **Full-Stack Engineer** who loves building products that people actually use.  
Frontend? I’ve got you. Backend? Also got you. Bugs? I hunt them down for sport. 🐛

If the problem is interesting, I can happily code for hours and forget the world exists.  
If the product is meaningful, I’ll care way too much about every tiny detail.

## 💼 Experience (short but strong)

### 🏢 Research & Development Engineer — Jukshio (Dec 2021 – Present)

I build big, real-world systems that handle real users and real data:

- 🪪 **Digital KYC Platforms** used by organizations like Manappuram & Muthoot
- 🎥 **Video KYC System** with real-time WebSockets, agent dashboards, and secure storage
- 🤖 **AI Interview & Recruitment Platform** with chat-based interviews and analytics
- 📊 **AI/ML Data Curation Dashboard** used by 400–500 users daily
- ⚡ Optimized APIs, queries, and performance so things actually feel fast

Basically — I make complex systems feel simple (or at least less painful 😄).

## 🧠 My Developer Philosophy (a bit meme, a bit serious)

- Write clean code… but ship it too 🚀
- If you can’t explain it simply, refactor it
- Performance matters (users feel it)
- Real users > perfect architecture
- Coffee > all ☕

---

## 🎯 What I’m open to

- Open-source contributions
- Interesting side projects
- Collaborations
